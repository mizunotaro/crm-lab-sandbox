# 0) Intent (6-step ops)
This Issue is queued for AI automation.
- You (AI) MUST: Plan -> Implement -> Verify -> Report.
- Human will intervene ONLY when you mark ai:blocked with options + decision criteria.

# 1) Goal (What to achieve)
Document minimum viable external attack protection (WAF/rate limiting) via Cloud Armor and load balancer, aligned to PoC needs.

# 2) Acceptance Criteria (AC) — MUST be checkable
- [ ] Docs exist: docs/security/cloud-armor.md
- [ ] Contains recommended baseline rules and next steps (Eval)
- [ ] No secrets in docs; uses placeholders
- [ ] CI is green (tests/build/lint/typecheck as applicable)
- [ ] No secrets exposed, no destructive ops
- [ ] No dependency changes unless Issue has label ai:deps

# 3) Constraints / Guardrails (hard)
- Scope: small PR only (minimal diff, no broad refactor)
- Security: never log/commit credentials
- If ambiguous: STOP and ask via PR description OR open ai:blocked with options
- Dependency changes allowed? No

# 4) Suggested Plan (optional but recommended)
1) Write baseline rule ideas (owasp, ip rate limit).
2) Document tradeoffs and costs (Eval).

# 5) Decision Gates (human-only; if needed)
If you must decide, convert this Issue to ai:blocked and include:
- Question:
- Option A: pros/cons, risk, effort, rollback
- Option B: pros/cons, risk, effort, rollback
- Decision criteria (what the human should optimize for)
