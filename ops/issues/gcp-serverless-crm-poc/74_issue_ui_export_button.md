# 0) Intent (6-step ops)
This Issue is queued for AI automation.
- You (AI) MUST: Plan -> Implement -> Verify -> Report.
- Human will intervene ONLY when you mark ai:blocked with options + decision criteria.

# 1) Goal (What to achieve)
Add an export button on customers list page to download CSV using the export endpoint.

# 2) Acceptance Criteria (AC) — MUST be checkable

- [ ] Click triggers file download (or opens new tab) without exposing secrets
- [ ] Unauthorized users cannot access export
- [ ] CI is green (tests/build/lint/typecheck as applicable)
- [ ] No secrets exposed, no destructive ops
- [ ] No dependency changes unless Issue has label ai:deps

# 3) Constraints / Guardrails (hard)
- Scope: small PR only (minimal diff, no broad refactor)
- Security: never log/commit credentials
- If ambiguous: STOP and ask via PR description OR open ai:blocked with options
- Dependency changes allowed? No

2) Ensure it includes auth cookies (same origin).
