# 0) Intent (6-step ops)
This Issue is queued for AI automation.
- You (AI) MUST: Plan -> Implement -> Verify -> Report.
- Human will intervene ONLY when you mark ai:blocked with options + decision criteria.

# 1) Goal (What to achieve)
Expose customer-related audit logs as a timeline endpoint to support support/debugging.

# 2) Acceptance Criteria (AC) — MUST be checkable
- [ ] GET /api/customers/:id/activity returns audit events (auth required)
- [ ] Events are limited to customer-related actions
- [ ] Automated test covers access control and basic response
- [ ] CI is green (tests/build/lint/typecheck as applicable)
- [ ] No secrets exposed, no destructive ops
- [ ] No dependency changes unless Issue has label ai:deps

# 3) Constraints / Guardrails (hard)
- Scope: small PR only (minimal diff, no broad refactor)
- Security: never log/commit credentials
- If ambiguous: STOP and ask via PR description OR open ai:blocked with options
- Dependency changes allowed? No

# 4) Suggested Plan (optional but recommended)
1) Add route handler filtering audit logs by customerId.
2) Return minimal event DTO.
3) Add tests.

# 5) Decision Gates (human-only; if needed)
If you must decide, convert this Issue to ai:blocked and include:
- Question:
- Option A: pros/cons, risk, effort, rollback
- Option B: pros/cons, risk, effort, rollback
- Decision criteria (what the human should optimize for)
