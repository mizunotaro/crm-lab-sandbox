# Session Log — 20260131_1346

- **Objective:** Add incident response template for security events (Issue #128)
- **Context:** Training repo needs incident response documentation aligned with AGENTS.md policies
- **Plan:**
  1. Create docs/ops/incident-response.md with security incident handling guidance
  2. Include PAUSE circuit breaker, evidence collection, rotation steps
  3. Ensure no secrets are exposed
  4. Verify CI remains green

- **Changes:**
  - Created docs/ops/incident-response.md (195 lines)
  - Template includes:
    - PAUSE circuit breaker (Section 0)
    - Identification and containment phases (Section 1)
    - Evidence collection guidance (Section 2) with NO secrets exposure
    - Eradication and recovery (Section 3) with general rotation guidance
    - Post-incident activities (Section 4)
    - Prevention checklist (Section 6)
  - File was force-added due to docs/ in .gitignore (consistent with docs/ai/ files)

- **Verification:**
  - File exists: `docs/ops/incident-response.md`
  - No secrets exposed: grep shows only generic references
  - Follows AGENTS.md guidelines: PowerShell examples, no destructive ops
  - Committed with conventional commit message: `docs: add incident response template for security events`

- **Results:**
  - Acceptance criteria met:
    - ✅ docs/ops/incident-response.md exists with steps and checklists
    - ✅ Template includes evidence collection + rotation guidance (no secrets)
    - ⏳ CI status pending (workflow check needed)

- **Risks:**
  - docs/ is in .gitignore but docs files are being committed (force-add)
  - Consider: Should .gitignore be updated to allow docs/ or specific subdirectories?
  - Risk level: Low

- **Next steps:**
  - Verify CI passes
  - Open PR for review
  - Update Issue #128 with summary
  - Consider creating ADR for docs/ gitignore policy if needed
