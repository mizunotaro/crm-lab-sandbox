# Session Log - 20260210_0514

- Objective: Address issue #404 - AI Watchdog: PAUSE recommended (failures=20)
- Context: Frequent CI failures detected in AI Orchestrator and AI Prerequisites Preflight Check workflows. Issue #404 recommends setting AI_AUTOMATION_MODE=PAUSE and running triage.
- Plan:
  1. Document the incident and required actions
  2. Create triage report for CI failures
  3. Recommend setting AI_AUTOMATION_MODE=PAUSE
  4. Create PR with documentation and recommendations

- Changes:
  - Created session log: docs/ai/session-log/20260210_0514.md
  - Created triage report: docs/ai/triage/20260210_404-ci-failures.md

- Verification:
  - Checked recent CI failures:
    - AI Orchestrator failure at 2026-02-10T03:14:47Z
    - AI Prerequisites Preflight Check failure at 2026-02-10T02:56:42Z
    - AI Prerequisites Preflight Check failure at 2026-02-10T02:09:16Z
  - Reviewed ai-watchdog.yml which runs every 15 minutes and monitors for failures

- Results:
  - Confirmed multiple CI failures in AI-related workflows
  - AI_AUTOMATION_MODE variable exists but cannot be modified directly via gh CLI due to API permissions (403 error)
  - Need manual intervention to set AI_AUTOMATION_MODE=PAUSE in repository settings

- Risks:
  - Continued AI automation may create more failing workflows and waste resources
  - Without PAUSE mode, automated AI operations will continue attempting to fix issues that may need human intervention
  - Potential for cascading failures if root cause is systemic

- Next steps:
  1. Human approval required to manually set AI_AUTOMATION_MODE=PAUSE in repository Settings > Actions > Variables
  2. After PAUSE is set, manually review and address failing CI workflows
  3. Once CI is green, consider resuming AI automation with AI_AUTOMATION_MODE=ACTIVE
  4. Monitor CI stability and adjust automation behavior as needed
