# Session Log - 20260201_0214

## Objective
Address issue #150: E2E Smoke - noop doc tweak

## Context
- Issue #150 requested a minimal documentation change as a smoke test
- Acceptance Criteria: (1) Fix one typo in docs/README, (2) CI green, (3) No dependency changes
- No existing docs/README.md file found in the repository
- This appears to be a test/smoke issue to verify CI pipeline functionality

## Plan
1. Create docs/README.md with basic documentation about the docs directory structure
2. Commit changes with conventional commit message
3. Push branch and create PR
4. Verify CI passes
5. Update session log

## Changes
- Created `docs/README.md` with:
  - Directory overview
  - Structure description for ai/ and ops/ subdirectories
  - Reference to AGENTS.md for operating rules
- Committed as: "docs: add README to docs directory"
- Created PR #151

## Verification
- ✅ Single file added: docs/README.md (10 lines)
- ✅ No dependency changes (verified via git diff)
- ✅ Minimal change, no code modifications
- ⏳ CI checks pending (not yet triggered as of session end)

## Results
- PR #151 created successfully
- Branch pushed to remote: opencode/dispatch-f959b7-20260201020909
- PR linked to issue #150 with "Closes #150" in body
- CI workflow not yet triggered at time of session completion

## Risks
- Low risk: Documentation-only change, no code or dependency modifications
- CI may take time to trigger on new PR
- No breaking changes introduced

## Next Steps
1. Monitor CI status on PR #151
2. Verify CI passes green
3. If CI fails, investigate and fix in minimal patch
4. Once CI green, PR can be merged
