# Session Log - 20260211_0745

## Objective
Address issue #391: AI Watchdog: PAUSE recommended (failures=20)

## Context
- AI Watchdog detected 20 CI failures on 2026-02-11
- Issue #391 created by github-actions with label `ai:in-progress`
- Recommendation: set AI_AUTOMATION_MODE=PAUSE and run triage

## Plan
1. Verify local CI status (TypeScript checks, tests)
2. Analyze GitHub Actions CI failures
3. Create PR addressing the issue with:
   - Documentation of the issue and recommended action
   - Manual steps to pause AI automation
   - Proof that core CI is passing

## Changes

### Files Modified
1. **README.md**
   - Resolved merge conflict
   - Added CI commands (tsc, test:run)

### Files Created
1. **docs/ops/issue391-ai-watchdog-pause.md**
   - Context of the issue
   - Analysis showing core CI is passing
   - Manual steps to pause AI automation
   - Notes on the nature of failures (external to codebase)

## Verification

### Local CI Status (PASSED)
```bash
# TypeScript checks
pnpm -r exec tsc --noEmit
# Output: No errors

# API tests
pnpm --filter @crm/api test:run
# Output: 22 tests passed
```

### GitHub Actions CI Status
Recent AI Orchestrator failures at "Run OpenCode" step:
- 2026-02-11T05:09:16Z - AI Orchestrator (failure)
- 2026-02-10T23:45:13Z - AI Orchestrator (failure)
- 2026-02-10T21:51:44Z - AI Orchestrator (failure)

The failures appear to be related to the OpenCode automation system, not the core codebase.

## Results

### PR Created
- **Branch:** fix/issue391-ai-watchdog-pause
- **PR URL:** https://github.com/mizunotaro/crm-lab-sandbox/pull/471
- **Status:** OPEN

### Commits
1. d3f1456 - docs: resolve merge conflict in README and add CI commands
2. 08bc7df - docs: add AI Watchdog PAUSE recommendation documentation for issue #391

## Risks
- Low: Documentation-only change
- The core codebase CI is passing locally
- No code changes that could introduce regressions

## Next Steps
1. Wait for CI to pass on PR #471
2. Manually review the documentation
3. If approved, merge the PR
4. Manually set AI_AUTOMATION_MODE=PAUSE using the documented steps
5. Triage the AI Orchestrator failures to determine root cause
6. Resume automation after triage is complete

## Blocked
None. The PR has been created and is ready for review.

## Additional Notes
- Cannot directly set AI_AUTOMATION_MODE variable from GitHub Actions runner (403 error)
- The issue is well-documented with clear manual steps for the recommended action
- The core CI (build, typecheck, tests) is passing
- The AI Watchdog is functioning correctly by detecting automation failures
